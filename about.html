                  Sensory play includes activities that stimulate children’s senses such as sight, sound, smell, taste
                  or
                  touch. By providing this type of activity children will learn more about the world around them in a
                  natural way, through their senses. Such activities contribute to brain development by stimulating
                  the
                  neurons in the brain to make connections, and help with development in all areas of learning.

                  class="square-image play-by-pic">
               <p class="right-align">
                  The most commonly stimulated sense for young children is sight. From birth, babies are given
                  brightly
                  coloured and patterned toys to look at and play with.
                  Exposing young children to new and interesting experiences will keep them curious about the world
                  around
                  them. Visually stimulating activities will enable children to use the sense of sight to discover
                  colours, shapes, brightness, form and structure. They will discover how things move and develop a
                  visual
                  memory as to how things work.

               <p class="left-align">
                  Many toys for young children feature music and other various sounds. Music is extremely important
                  for
                  children and many learn best when a concept is set to music. Music can encourage motor skills
                  development as children learn to dance and to keep a beat. Singing songs, listening to stories and
                  talking about what they are doing all help children with sound and listening skills. Wind chimes,
                  music
                  boxes, shakers, objects to bang and music to listen and move to will all enhance this area of
                  learning
                  and development.

               <p class="right-align">
                  The sense of smell helps children to identify scents they like or don’t like and can be incorporated
                  into planning in many ways. Try adding an array of fragrances into your treasure box, such as
                  coffee,
                  mint, lemon and lavender. Providing these different smells allows the children to differentiate
                  between
                  new scents and build on their learning through their sense of smell.

               <p class="left-align">
                  The sense of touch can be best explored through textures and messy play. Young babies like to
                  snuggle in
                  with soft blankets and investigate treasure baskets, older babies and toddlers will enjoy messy play
                  activities to explore new textures. Going on a ‘touch’ walk will encourage children to touch new
                  items
                  for texture such as rough and smooth, wet puddles, tree bark and some plants.

               <p class="right-align">
                  Through the sense of taste children will get to explore new foods, fruits and vegetables and decide
                  which ones they like and do not like. Finger foods are a good way to encourage independence for
                  toddlers
                  so that they can feed themselves. Cooking activities will encourage children to join in the process
                  of
                  making meals and treats. They are more likely to try new things if they are involved in making and
                  preparing them.

                  Anxiety in children can look like many things. It can look like anger, sadness, grumpiness,
                  self-doubt,
                  or even a bad mood that your child can’t seem to shake. Big emotions like these are a normal part of
                  childhood as children are still developing emotion regulation. Most of the time, these big emotions
                  will
                  come and go and kids bounce back happy to go on with their day.
                  But what about when the bad mood seems to stick, when your child can’t seem to stop worrying, or
                  when
                  tantrums are frequent and intense? This can be an indication that your child is feeling some stress
                  or
                  underlying anxiety.
                  A great way to help kids with anxiety is to bolster up their sense of self so they can distance
                  themselves from their feelings. One of the best ways to help kids re-center when they are feeling
                  worried or upset to engage them in sensory play that, but it’s very nature is immersive and mindful.
