        <div class="solid-orange">
            <p>
                Sensory play includes activities that stimulate children’s senses such as sight, sound, smell, taste or
                touch. By providing this type of activity children will learn more about the world around them in a
                natural way, through their senses. Such activities contribute to brain development by stimulating the
                neurons in the brain to make connections, and help with development in all areas of learning.

        <h3 id="sight">Sight <i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> </h3>
        <div class="solid-blue">

            <p class="right-align">
                The most commonly stimulated sense for young children is sight. From birth, babies are given brightly
                coloured and patterned toys to look at and play with.

                Exposing young children to new and interesting experiences will keep them curious about the world around
                them. Visually stimulating activities will enable children to use the sense of sight to discover
                colours, shapes, brightness, form and structure. They will discover how things move and develop a visual
                memory as to how things work.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="sound">Sound <i class="fas fa-assistive-listening-systems" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
        <div class="solid-pink">
            <img src="./assets/images/play_by_sound.jpg" alt="a young girl holding up a home made tin and string phone to her ear" class="square_image play_by_pic">
            <p class="left-align">


                Many toys for young children feature music and other various sounds. Music is extremely important for
                children and many learn best when a concept is set to music. Music can encourage motor skills
                development as children learn to dance and to keep a beat. Singing songs, listening to stories and
                talking about what they are doing all help children with sound and listening skills. Wind chimes, music
                boxes, shakers, objects to bang and music to listen and move to will all enhance this area of learning
                and development.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="smell">Smell <i class="fas fa-bacon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
        <div class="solid-grey">
            <img src="./assets/images/play_by_smell.jpg" alt="a young girl smelling a flower" class="square_image play_by_pic">
            <p class="right-align">


                The sense of smell helps children to identify scents they like or don’t like and can be incorporated
                into planning in many ways. Try adding an array of fragrances into your treasure box, such as coffee,
                mint, lemon and lavender. Providing these different smells allows the children to differentiate between
                new scents and build on their learning through their sense of smell.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="touch">Touch <i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
        <div class="solid-green">
            <img src="./assets/images/play_by_touch.jpg" alt="a young girl playing with a bead and metal toy" class="square_image play_by_pic">
            <p class="left-align">


                The sense of touch can be best explored through textures and messy play. Young babies like to snuggle in
                with soft blankets and investigate treasure baskets, older babies and toddlers will enjoy messy play
                activities to explore new textures. Going on a ‘touch’ walk will encourage children to touch new items
                for texture such as rough and smooth, wet puddles, tree bark and some plants.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="taste">Taste <i class="fas fa-grin-tongue" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
        <div class="solid-peach">
            <img src="./assets/images/play_with_mum.jpg" alt="a young mum and her daughter sorting through drinking cups" class="square_image play_by_pic">
            <p class="right-align">


                Through the sense of taste children will get to explore new foods, fruits and vegetables and decide
                which ones they like and do not like. Finger foods are a good way to encourage independence for toddlers
                so that they can feed themselves. Cooking activities will encourage children to join in the process of
                making meals and treats. They are more likely to try new things if they are involved in making and
                preparing them.</p>
