                    the children.
                    I often refer parents to the site to introduce Sensory Play at home as it is easy to use and
                    includes

                    I make a bowl of jelly, a bowl of rice and a bowl of spaghetti. I will hide a few small toys inside
                    each bowl.
                    The kids love getting in there, exploring the different food textures and finding little treasures."

                <p>"My daughter is a sensitive little girl and can really struggle with sensory overload. We have made
                    some sensory
                    boards for her bedroom which help her process and explore. We have a sight board, with beautiful
                    nature, people and
                    architecture photos. A touch board containing different materials and textures and a taste board
                    with pictures and drawings
                    of food and drinks. I highly recommend this!"

                    always
                    recommend to parents to do at home is the shaving foam activity. Simply, smear shaving foam on the

                    the shower door. Allow your child to draw pictures, shapes or simply smear the foam around!"

                <p>"I have learnt so much since I started using this site. I have also come up with some creative
                    sensory ideas
                    myself. The best thing is, you don't even need to make anything. When we go out to the seaside, we
                    have a nature
                    hunt, looking for shells, rocks, seaweed, anything we can find and compare the feel, the smell, the
                    sounds and how
                    the items are the same or different. We really enjoy playing together."
