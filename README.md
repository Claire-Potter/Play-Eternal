### A website by Claire Potter

A website that provides information on sensory play and advice on sensory play activities as well as specific advice on how sensory play helps children cope with anxiety. Professionals can refer parents to use the site to assist with at home sensory play.

## Purpose
The theme I have chosen for project one is sensory play. My aim is to create a website utilising HTML and CSS that provides a straight forward explanation of sensory play. 

I chose the theme of sensory play because recently my son was struggling with high anxiety after returning to school. I interacted with both his teacher and his Parent Support Advisor(PSA) and was provided with various websites and resources with information, ideas and activities to implement to help. As a parent I spent a lot of time going through multiple sites, long-winded pages of information and only then getting to some straight forward activities to complete with him. Out of everything I explored I found that the sensory play activities really soothed him and enabled him to express his emotions to me. 
Both of my sons thoroughly enjoyed taking part in the activities and I really learnt a lot about the importance sensory play plays in childhood development.

Based off my own experience as a parent and my interactions with professionals, I utilised this experience to come up with personas to really shape my initial idea by understanding user needs and a user's experience.

## Persona Overview

### Primary Persona

I have established that my primary user is a parent of young children / a young child. 
My secondary users would be Teachers, PSAs or Occupational Therapists referring parents to the website for support.

## Strategy

I have taken some time to answer the following high-level strategic questions:

 1. Is the content culturally appropriate? 

	The content needs to be aimed at an English speaking, everyday parent. This is not an academic article or a technically complicated site, it needs to be simple, user friendly and written in easy to understand language.

 2. Is the content relevant? 
 
  A parent would like to see the following with regards to content:

 - Easy to understand and to the point. They are not looking for an   
   academic article, rather a straight forward explanation as to what   
   sensory play is and how it can be utilised.
 - Visually pleasing but not overwhelming. 
 - Simple and intuitive navigation.
 - Activities that are cost effective and easy to complete at home.
 - Images and videos that they can watch and engage with to reinforce learning and understanding.
 - Able to hear form other parents and teachers regarding their experience using the site as well as their feedback on sensory play.
 - Able to engage and provide own feedback.
 - For the secondary personas it is important to know that the content is reliable and easy to understand.

 3. Can we track and catalogue the content in an intuitive way? 

 - The content needs to be easily accessible. The website should be readable on any device in particular a mobile phone  as many people don't have access to a desktop or a laptop.
 - As a parent progresses through the site, it is important that questions are answered according to priority:
 -- What is sensory play?
-- Why is it beneficial?
-- What can I do with my child?
-- How does it help with anxiety?
-- What are others saying?
-- Where can I engage to ask questions and provide feedback?

 4. Is the technology appropriate?  
	 
	 The site is written in HTML and CSS which is more than adequate to create an informative and engaging website. 
The target audience, parents, will be able to access the website across all devices and the screen  would render accordingly.

### High-level Business Goals:

 - Create a well thought-out and user friendly website.
 - All content to be concise and easy to understand.
 - The purpose of the website is to help parents.
 - To be utilised by schools and occupational therapists to refer parents to for at home support.

### Value:

The value lies in providing the content in an easy to use way to allow the parent to understand the concept and activities as quickly as possible and to be able to implement the learning at home with their child.
How easy they find it to learn and whether they see the implemented learnings helping their child will determine how valuable they will deem the site to be.
The more success that schools and Occupational Therapists see through referring the parents to the website, the greater the use of the site will be.

### Why is this site so special?

There are multiple sites available on sensory play and sensory play activities. 

What makes this site special:

 - The consistency and simplicity of the pages. Other sites have too
   much information and it is overwhelming.
 - The flow of information as you browse through the site. Easy and
   intuitive navigation and the content leads on from  one section to
   the next. Other sites have too many tabs and too much noise. It
   becomes easy to disengage.
 - Consistent layout, colours, visual aids and messaging. The different
   pages speak to each other, reinforce the overall feel of the site
   whilst engaging the user.
 - The way the site is packaged really determines whether the user's
   experience will be positive or negative.
   
### Trade-offs

Using the trade-off process to rank the importance and feasibility of the opportunities I have decided:

1. To go ahead with 4/5 of the opportunities.
2. For the parent "chat" section, I will change the "chat" feature to a simple site page that provides other parents feedback and recommendations for the first release of the site.
3. The opportunity to unpack the "chat"  opportunity and scale it will be a future consideration.

## Storyboard

The below storyboard represents a high-level  interpretation of the ideal user experience when a parent utilises
the website:

## Journey Maps

The following journey maps represent the user experience:

 2. [After the Play Eternal Website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Claire-Potter/Play_Eternal/master/wireframes/Post-Website%20Journey%20Map.png)

## Scope
For the primary user - parents, to provide them with a user-friendly solution to understand and implement sensory play at home without the need to go through mass amounts of information. A reliable website that can be utilised by schools and occupational therapists to advise parents on sensory play and at home activities. There is a potential selling opportunity to sell subscriptions to utilise the site to school boards and practices. This would be a future endeavour and out of scope for the first release.

## Structure
Development conventions and best practice have been applied as far as possible to ensure that user expectations are met. The breakdown of the structure is available further down in this document within the features section.

### Surface

I chose the following colour palette because the pastel colours are soothing and calm, it allowed me to create a clean look and feel whilst still injecting a bit of fun - always essential when it comes to children.
