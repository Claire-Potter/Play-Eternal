# UX Design

## Persona Overview

![An over view page of the personas, their names, job titles, background information, a quote and their user stories.](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/persona-overview.png?raw=true)

### Primary Persona

I have established that my primary user is a parent of young children / a young child. 
My secondary users would be Teachers, PSAs or Occupational Therapists referring parents to the website for support.
![An image of the details of the primary persona, name, title, background, key characteristics, designation, goals and tech preferences](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/persona-detail.png?raw=true)

### User Stories

- Primary User

1. I would like to learn about sensory play in a concise way.
2. I would like to find sensory play activities that engage both of my children.
3. Information and creative activities that directly address anxiety.
4. I need a site that is straight forward and easy for me to use at home.
5. Any feedback and recommendations would be useful.
6. A way to contact the site owner to ask questions, provide feedback and recommendations.

- Secondary User One

1. Easy to utilise resource, can be used by any parent or teacher.
2. Somewhere I can refer parents to to help their child at home.
3. New ways for parents to include daily activities that engage all five senses; sight, sound, smell, touch and taste.
4. Straight forward and affordable activities that can engage multiple children at a time.
5. An easy way to hear from other teachers and parents to learn from each other.

- Secondary User Two

1. A clear direct and educational website educating and advising parents on sensual play.
2. Ability for parents to ask questions.

- Secondary User Three

1. Easy to understand explanation of sensory play.
2. Straight forward and simple activities are a must.
3. A resource which is intuitive as well as engaging.

## Strategy

I have taken some time to answer the following high-level strategic questions:

 1. Is the content culturally appropriate? 

	The content needs to be aimed at an English speaking, everyday parent. This is not an academic article or a technically complicated site, it needs to be simple, user friendly and written in easy to understand language.

 2. Is the content relevant? 
 
  A parent would like to see the following with regards to content:

 - Easy to understand and to the point. They are not looking for an   
   academic article, rather a straight forward explanation as to what   
   sensory play is and how it can be utilised.
 - Visually pleasing but not overwhelming. 
 - Simple and intuitive navigation.
 - Activities that are cost effective and easy to complete at home.
 - Images and videos that they can watch and engage with to reinforce learning and understanding.
 - Able to hear form other parents and teachers regarding their experience using the site as well as their feedback on sensory play.
 - Able to engage and provide own feedback.
 - For the secondary personas it is important to know that the content is reliable and easy to understand.

 3. Can we track and catalogue the content in an intuitive way? 

 - The content needs to be easily accessible. The website should be readable on any device in particular a mobile phone  as many people don't have access to a desktop or a laptop.
 - As a parent progresses through the site, it is important that questions are answered according to priority:
 	- What is sensory play?
	- Why is it beneficial?
	- What can I do with my child?
	- How does it help with anxiety?
	- What are others saying?
	- Where can I engage to ask questions and provide feedback?

 4. Is the technology appropriate?  
	 
	 The site is written in HTML and CSS which is more than adequate to create an informative and engaging website. 
The target audience, parents, will be able to access the website across all devices and the screen  would render accordingly.

### High-level Business Goals

 - Create a well thought-out and user friendly website.
 - All content to be concise and easy to understand.
 - The purpose of the website is to help parents.
 - To be utilised by schools and occupational therapists to refer parents to for at home support.

### Value

The value lies in providing the content in an easy to use way to allow the parent to understand the concept and activities as quickly as possible and to be able to implement the learning at home with their child.
How easy they find it to learn and whether they see the implemented learnings helping their child will determine how valuable they will deem the site to be.
The more success that schools and Occupational Therapists see through referring the parents to the website, the greater the use of the site will be.

### Why is this site so special?

There are multiple sites available on sensory play and sensory play activities. 

What makes this site special:

 - The consistency and simplicity of the pages. Other sites have too
   much information and it is overwhelming.
 - The flow of information as you browse through the site. Easy and
   intuitive navigation and the content leads on from  one section to
   the next. Other sites have too many tabs and too much noise. It
   becomes easy to disengage.
 - Consistent layout, colours, visual aids and messaging. The different
   pages speak to each other, reinforce the overall feel of the site
   whilst engaging the user.
 - The way the site is packaged really determines whether the user's
   experience will be positive or negative.
   
### Trade-offs

Using the trade-off process to rank the importance and feasibility of the opportunities I have decided:

1. To go ahead with 4/5 of the opportunities.
2. For the parent "chat" section, I will change the "chat" feature to a simple site page that provides other parents feedback and recommendations for the first release of the site.
3. The opportunity to unpack the "chat"  opportunity and scale it will be a future consideration.

![Table depicting the Importance rating vs. the Feasibility rating per Opportunity](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/opportunity-table.PNG?raw=true)
   
## Storyboard

The below storyboard represents a high-level  interpretation of the ideal user experience when a parent utilises
the website:

![A cartoon depiction containing six frames playing out the desired user experience](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/storyboard.png?raw=true)

## Journey Maps

The following journey maps represent the user experience:

 1. [Before the Play Eternal Website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/master/project-documents/project-images/pre-website-journey-map.png)
 2. [After the Play Eternal Website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/master/project-documents/project-images/post-website-journey-map.png)

## Scope
For the primary user - parents, to provide them with a user-friendly solution to understand and implement sensory play at home without the need to go through mass amounts of information. A reliable website that can be utilised by schools and occupational therapists to advise parents on sensory play and at home activities. 

### Feature Trade Off

![Feature Trade-Off Table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/master/project-documents/project-images/scope-table.png)


This site will be developed as a minimum viable product. Future releases could include additional functionality depending on the success of the first release.

## Surface

I chose the following colour palette because the pastel colours are soothing and calm, it allowed me to create a clean look and feel whilst still injecting a bit of fun - always essential when it comes to children.

![Pastel color palette used for site design](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/colour-palette.png?raw=true)

I felt it was necessary to keep the pages clean and simple to prevent the user from feeling overwhelmed and disoriented. All images were chosen specifically for the sections they were added to and where possible they were set as square with the same border. The background colours were repeated across all pages. The font was set as default Itim Regular for headings and Montserrat for text, with Sans serif as a backup for both. It was important to create a fluid feeling across the site pages to provide continuity.

### Design Mock ups

1. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/master/project-documents/design-mock-ups/home-page.png" target="_blank">Home Page</a>

4. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/master/project-documents/design-mock-ups/sensory-play-and-anxiety.png" target="_blank">Sensory Play and Anxiety</a>
5. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/master/project-documents/design-mock-ups/hear-from-each-other.png" target="_blank">Hear From Each Other</a>
6. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/master/project-documents/design-mock-ups/get-in-touch.png" target="_blank">Get In Touch</a>

### Design Differences

1. The Home Page logo - Play Eternal - the icon utilised was chosen from Font Awesome and is not a child in a square as per the mock up.
2. In the navigation bar - Contact Us was renamed Get In Touch for consistency with the page title.
3. A sub-navigation menu for the All About Sensory Play page was included instead of featuring a second navigation on the page directly. This provides a more consistent navigation approach instead of creating an additional menu.
4. The Learn More button colour was changed from orange to teal as visually it looked more appealing. The arrow icon was removed to keep the look clean and simple and to align with the look of the submit button.
5. The All About Sensory Play page - the icons used are from Font Awesome and slightly different to those shown in the mock up.
6. Originally it was planned to have a transparency applied to the colour background boxes, however it made the content more difficult to read and did not work as well as a solid background so this was changed.
7. The tooltip was included on the help with anxiety page which was not in the mock up.
8. The Hear From Each Other background colours are once again not transparent.
9. The number of children question was removed from the form on the Get In Touch page, as a user would provide the children's ages in the question below and number of children can be deduced from there.

### Design Breakdown

Talk about sizes, colours choices etc -everything made in CSS.

## Technologies

The following languages were used to create the website:

1. HTML

## Header

![Header image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/header.PNG?raw=true)
The Header is consistent across all four site pages. It contains the site logo and the navigation bar. Its display setting is flex and the flex-direction is set as row. For ease of use the Header has been fixed and made sticky across all pages so that as the user scrolls, the navigation is still available. To ensure that the site is responsive the flex-direction is changed to column for smaller screen widths.
For further information on the sticky navigation please click here.

![Sticky Header image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/sticky-nav.PNG?raw=true)

 - **Header Logo**

<img src="https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/header-logo.PNG?raw=true" 
     alt="Header Logo image" 
     style="display:block; 
            float:none; 
            margin-left:auto; 
            margin-right:auto;
            "> 

 - The logo is created using the Itim font from Google fonts with the letter spacing set at 3px and the hand holding heart icon from Font Awesome. It contains a link back to the home page as it is an expected behaviour that clicking the logo will take a user home.

-   **Navigation Bar**

![Navigation Bar image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/navigation-bar.PNG?raw=true)

   -   The navigation bar is identical across all four pages to allow for easy navigation. 
    - The bar  includes the following:
	    - The active page is highlighted with a different font colour and background colour.
	    
 ![Navigation Active image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/navigation-active.PNG?raw=true)
 
  - The All About Sensory Play includes a drop-down menu to the separate page sections as this is the longest page with the most content.
 - For further information on the drop-down please click here.
	    
 ![Navigation dropdown image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/navigation-dropdown.jpg?raw=true)
 
  -   The navigation provides the user with the ability to navigate across all pages with ease.
   
## Footer

![Footer image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/Footer.PNG?raw=true)
    
The footer section is fixed to the bottom of the page and it includes a logo and social media icons. It is consistent across all four site pages.

 - **Footer Logo**

 ![Footer Logo image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/footer-logo.PNG?raw=true)

 - The logo is a smaller version of the Header logo but displayed vertically. Underneath the page copyright is included. Like the Header, it includes a link back to the home page as this is common for websites to do.
	 
-   **Social Media Icons**

![Social Media Icons image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/social-media-icons.PNG?raw=true)

   -   The Social Media Icons are grouped together and included on the right hand side of the footer as this is a common section for the icons to be located so the user can expect to find them there.
    - The Icons contain links to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and the social media sites will open on individual pages so they do not take the user away from our site.
    - They provide the user with an easy way to connect to Play Eternal's social media sites to be able to interact socially.

## Home Page

![Home Page image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/home-page-site.PNG?raw=true)


The Home Page has been created to include a Hero Image with a text box overlay. It has been kept simple with limited information, to create an invitation to the user to explore the rest of the site. It is like the cover of a book - inviting the user in to read/explore further.
 -   **The landing page image**
![Home Page image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/assets/images/home-page.jpg?raw=true)

- The landing page image is a background image which is a photograph of a little girl playing with a hoop. The colours makes sense with the site colour scheme. The text area has been placed so that the little girl is looking directly at it, leading the user to read the information. The area is responsive and will resize. When the screen width is smaller, the image is replaced with a smaller image of a boy playing so that it fits and is clearly visible.

![Home Page image small](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/assets/images/home-page-smaller.jpg?raw=true)
	
 -   **The Text Area**

 ![Text Area Image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/text-area.PNG?raw=true)

- The text area contains a call to action to parents, as our primary user, it provides description as to why they would need sensory play for their child and it then invites them to follow the learn more button to learn how to help their child. By utilising a call to action it entices the user to click to access the next page.

 -   **The Learn More Button**

 ![Learn More Image](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/learn-more-button.PNG?raw=true)

 - The learn more button will take the user to the All About Sensory Play page. It is formatted to stand out within the text area and includes a button shadow when the user hovers over it to provide the feeling of pushing a button.

	
## All About Sensory Play

 ![All About Sensory Play Page](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/all-about-sensory-play.PNG?raw=true)
	
The All About Sensory Play page is the main content page of the site. It's purpose is to educate the user on what sensory play is, provide ideas on sensory play activities and explain how sensory play can assist with childhood anxiety. The page should encourage the user to pursue sensory play activities to see the benefit of including them to support their child's development. Our specific user has been seeking help for her child's anxiety, the help with anxiety section provides this. The page has been created as a continuous page with sections instead of separate pages as users are used to a continuous scroll action and it minimises the amounts of clicks required to access the site features. A scroll-behavior setting set to smooth has been added to the html in the CSS to improve the ease of scrolling.

 -   **What is Sensory Play ?**

 ![What is Sensory Play Page](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/what-is-sensory-play.PNG?raw=true)
    
   -   This section provides a simple explanation of sensory play. It is important to keep the information concise and to the point to ensure the user does not lose interest and keeps on exploring.
    - Each sub-point of information has an individually coloured background. The colours are repeated across the site to create a concise experience.
    - There is an explanation of sensory play across all the senses - Sight, Sound, Smell, Touch and Taste to help the user connect with their own senses and get an understanding of how to introduce sensory play into their child's life. 
    - An engaging image is included per sense. The images all include children so as the user can relate the sense with playing with their child.
    -   This user will see the value of sensory play through this section as it provides understanding as well as making it relatable.

 -   **Play in Motion**

  ![Play in Motion Page](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/play-in-motion.PNG?raw=true)
    
  -   This section includes a six minute video clip on sensory play and play ideas in the home.
   - It provides the user with the option to explore the information in a visual format. It is important for a user to engage with material in a format that they are comfortable with.
    -   The video is hosted on YouTube but play directly on the site. It can be enlarged to full screen.

 -   **Activities**

  ![Activities Page](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/sensory-play-activities.PNG?raw=true)
    
   -   The Activities section introduces the user to the top ten recommended sensory play activities. All of the activities are very simple, easy and affordable to create at home.
    - The section adds value to the user as they will be able to use the information to create the activities in their own home without breaking the budget. 
   - Each activity has its own coloured background just like the What is Sensory Play section, to continue the narrative of the page.
    - Three images are included alongside the activities to provide some colour and display of sensory play.

 -   **Help with Anxiety**

  ![Help with Anxiety Page](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/help-with-anxiety.PNG?raw=true)
    
   -   This page section directly answers our user's need for help with childhood anxiety.
   - It includes a brief explanation of what childhood anxiety might look like and what a parent can do to help.
    - It then provides some mindful and calming activities for the user to take away and do with their child.
   - This section provides value to the user at it provides a practical solution to their problem.
   - As there is a lot of written information on the page, the anxiety activities section is presented as a compact grid of  six images with an image caption providing the activity name.
   - By simply hovering over the image caption, a tool-tip pop-up provides a description of the activity. The user will be prompted to hover as the image caption has a dotted underline, which is commonly used to show tool-tips and familiar to users.
   - For further information on the tool-tip please click here.

![Anxiety Tooltip](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/anxiety-tooltip.PNG?raw=true)
 
 ## Hear from Each Other

![Hear From Each Other Page](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/hear-from-each-other.PNG?raw=true)

 The Hear from Each Other section provides the user with the opportunity to hear from other parents, teachers and occupational therapists. It is important for the user to receive positive affirmation regarding sensory play directly from other users of the site.
 
 -   **Feedback**

 ![Feedback Section](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/feedback.PNG?raw=true)

 - The feedback section contains four individual feedback write ups. Each person has a profile picture and a heading with their name, children's ages or their role (for the teachers or occupational therapist). It is important for the user to build confidence in sensory play through reading the encouraging and positive feedback.
 - 
 -   **Recommendations**

![Recommendations Section](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/recommendations.PNG?raw=true)


 - The recommendations section mirrors the feedback section in its setup for consistency. It is important for parents and experts to be able to vocalise their own recommendations and for a user to be able to read them and use their suggestions or come up with their own own creative sensory play. 
 
 ## Get In Touch

![Get In Touch Page](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/get-in-touch.PNG?raw=true)

 The get in touch section provides the user with the ability to contact the site owners. There is a background image of a little boy happily engaging in sensory play in his sand pit. It evokes a sense of accomplishment by reinforcing that sensory play can be easily implemented at home and benefit your child. It reflects the setup of the home page, like the back cover of a book, letting the user know they have reached the end of the site content.
 
 -  **Form**

 ![Form](https://github.com/Claire-Potter/Play-Eternal/blob/master/project-documents/project-images/form.PNG?raw=true)

 - The form is added as an overlay on the background image to reflect the text area on the front page. 
 - The form layout and display is kept as simple as possible to convey the message to the user that it is simple and easy to complete.
 - The name, surname, email, child/children's ages and feedback are added as input elements and are validated as required. The feedback on the website, questions and recommendations sections are added as text areas and are not required but optional.
 - This is the area in which a user can ask any questions they may have and provide their own feedback and recommendations which could be featured on the Hear from Each Other Page.
 - The Submit button reflects the same display options as the Learn More button found on the home page. 

  ### Features Left to Implement
-   Chat Page
	- A page in which users are able to chat to each other about sensory play, ask questions and receive answers from other users as well as from the site owner.
	- Users would be able to add their own content through images and videos to recommend sensory play ideas.
	- A terms and conditions disclaimer and the ability to setup a user profile would need to be introduced in order for a user to interact on the site page.
	- Content posted by users would need to be monitored for propriety.
	- The ability to report inappropriate comments and content would be required.
	
- As this is the first release of the site, the chat page was not included in the implementation due to its complexities. Rather, a simplified version in the form of a Feedback and Recommendations page.
	- The implementation of the chat page would depend on the page traffic generated by the live site and the level of interaction received from the users would help to deem its feasibility.
